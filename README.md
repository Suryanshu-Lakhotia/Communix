# Communix
## A communication platform for everyone

### Purpose 

To help deaf and mute people communicate with ease. Eliminate need to pen down notes in meetings.

### Problem

* It is tough for mute people to communicate with people unknown to sign language.
* Existing communication platforms do not include sign language recognition.
* For people with hearing aid, video calling does not suffice without subtitles.
* It becomes difficult for two people to communicate without a language in common.
* Making notes in meeting becomes a tedious task, people either miss useful information or fail to concentrate on the agenda.

### Solution

* Create a video chatting platform that auto generates subtitles(Helpful for the deaf people).
* Video chatting platform to include a sign language recognition system(Helpful for the mute people). 
* Translated subtitles(For better communication among the people who share no language in common).
* Live conversion of dialogues to text with speaker's name and timestamp (For creating notes in meeting).
